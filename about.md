# About

## What is this?

This is a website where I collect my short stories and other writing. Time permitting, I will include web serials and possibly essays in the future.

## I want to read something. Where should I start?

If you don't have much time, start with [Troop forth replenish'd](troop-forth-replenishd.md), which is very short. If you have a little longer, [A week in the life of](a-week-in-the-life-of.md) is probably my most popular story. [A veil of brightness](a-veil-of-brightness.md) is the longest finished story at about 20 000 words (half a Gatsby).

I currently have a web serial---a novel published piecemeal on the web---called _A vigil for humanity_. I'm trying to find some time to figure out how to put this in the website. You can currently read it [on Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/113171/a-vigil-for-humanity).

## Can I use or adapt something you've written?

All short stories currently published on the front page are released under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). That means you are free to use any material from them, or to adapt them for commercial or non-commercial work, so long as you credit me. The form of credit depends a little on the medium you use. I'd prefer credit at the start (where that makes sense), but at the end is fine too. Where possible, please include the title of the original story and a link to the website. If this is not possible, reach out to me on Bluesky or mastodon to discuss. 

Fan art is fair use, and does not require credit.

Don't expect me to endorse something you make. Even if it's good, it might simply not be what _I_ imagined when I wrote the story. This applies especially if generative AI is involved. I'm not fully anti-AI, but I do find that these works are currently quite low effort and derivative by nature, with little respect for the work that went into the styles they ape. Still, technology evolves, and I'm always happy to be proved wrong.

Either way, I strongly believe in open culture, and that means allowing adaptations that I might not like myself. I will always be happy that people cared enough to make the adaptation, 

**AI training** This license includes the right to use these stories in AI training data. However, if the resulting AI system spits out something that is similar enough to my stories to be covered by copyright, then it's the responsibility of the system to give credit. If this is not technically possible, then the stories should not be included.
